# API Routes

## Implementation Guidelines

- Use Zod for request body validation
- Create separate functions for business logic
- Wrap route handlers with `withError` middleware
- Export typed responses for client usage

- For routes with dynamic parameters, use the new Next.js 15+ params format with async params
